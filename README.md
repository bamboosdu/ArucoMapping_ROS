# aruco_mapping_melodic
ROS aruco_mapping package for ROS melodic version.
This is the melodic compatible version for [aruco_mapping](http://wiki.ros.org/aruco_mapping) package. Also, I have extracted functionalities from the processImage function into smaller methods for better readability. For documentation, please refer the original package.
